WeatherPy Analysis

1) The strongest correlation of all variables according to our linear regression plots is the Temperature vs Latitude Correlation. The temperature clearly tends
	to rise or fall depending on latitude.
2) In general selected cities were more likely to have a higher humidity. The top 75% of the data was 64% humidity or more. The lowest reading wasn't even 0.

3) At the time this data was retrieved there was absolutely no correlation with cloudiness. There did not seem to be any consistency among longitude and latitude.
